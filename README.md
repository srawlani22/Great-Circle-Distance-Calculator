# Great-Circle-Distance-Calculator
This code was used as a technical assessment for a software developer role at University of Texas Austin's Bureau of Economic Geology.

The comments and the description at the beginning of the code should give a broad explanation of how the code works and is designed.

To run the code, please do the following:
1. Make sure to have a c++ compiler, the online c++ compiler should work as well.
2. After running the code, you will have 4 prompts. Enter the first latitude, then the first longitude, followed by the second latitude and the second longitude respectively and hit enter. The program will then give you the Great Circle Distance between the coordinates on the surface of the earth.
